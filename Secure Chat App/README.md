# 🔐 Secure Chat App (End-to-End Encrypted Messaging)

A simple Python-based chat application that supports **end-to-end encryption** using **RSA public-key cryptography**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Most chat applications do not provide strong encryption by default, exposing private conversations to risks. This project demonstrates how to create a secure channel using public-key cryptography for private messaging.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a secure chat tool with:
- Encrypted two-way messaging
- RSA key pair exchange
- Real-time communication using sockets

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `PyCryptodome` (for encryption)
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
